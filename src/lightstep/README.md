# lightstep-tracer-cpp

The LightStep distributed tracing library for C++.

## Status 

Note: the LightStep C++ library does not bind to the [OpenTracing C++ library](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-cpp) and is not yet fully OpenTracing-compliant. Please [get in touch](mailto:hello@lightstep.com) or [log a issue](https://github.com/lightstep/lightstep-tracer-cpp/issues) to let us know if you'd interested in contributing to the development of the library. 

Please see [the LightStep docs](http://lightstep.com/docs/) for a list of LightStep OpenTracing-compliant platforms.
